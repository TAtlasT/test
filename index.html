<h1>Welcome oh fair ones, your journey awaits!</h1>
<p><b>Hello there my fellow travelers! Fancy seeing you here along this golden road that leads to the great and only castle belonging to that of the Great King Darius. <br> Beware of what lies ahead for this road is not for the weak and weary and there are many paths to partake! If you so choose you can turn back if you feel you don't have <br>the chops for it but if you continue there is no turning back let alone any guarantee for your safety...<b></p>
